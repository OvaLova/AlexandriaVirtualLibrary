Virtual library of mathematics related contents made up from a server and clients. 

The server is unique and allows multiple connections through TCP, with threaded handling of each client via two sockets: one for downloading files from the library, the other for exchanging chats with other clients connected to the server. 

The clients can run on different PCs or local networks and connect to the server knowing its IP address. The information exchange between client and server is mediated by a friendly GUI on the client side.
